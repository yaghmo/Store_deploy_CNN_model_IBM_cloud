# Description:

This repository contains a project focused on exploring IBM Cloud services for machine learning, specifically for training, storing, and deploying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify six types of jellyfish. The primary goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience with IBM Cloud computing rather than achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy.


# Dependencies

To install required dependencies run (python vesion 3.10):

**`$ pip install -r requirements.txt`**

# Notebooks:

* `ðŸ“œ Train_model.ipynb` In this notebook, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is implemented and trained to classify jellyfish images into six different types. The focus is on the utilization of IBM Cloud services for storing and deploying the model.

* `ðŸ“œ Store_model.ipynb` -- This notebook demonstrates how to use IBM Cloud services to store the trained model in the deployement space using an API key.

* `ðŸ“œ Deploy_model.ipynb` --  This notebook demonstrates how to deploy a model for inference. It provides step-by-step instructions on deploying the model in a cloud environment.


# Project Highlights:

* Purpose: Explore and utilize IBM Cloud services for machine learning on Watson Sutido.
* Model: CNN for jellyfish classification with an accuracy of 72%.
* Dataset: Images of six different types of jellyfish ( Sauce : [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/jellyfish-types) ).
* Note: The emphasis of the project is on learning and using IBM Cloud computing rather than achieving optimal classification performance.
* Feel free to explore the notebooks and adapt the project for your own learning and experimentation with IBM Cloud services. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

Happy coding!
